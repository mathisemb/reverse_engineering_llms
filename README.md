# Reverse-engineering LLMs: making the most of the context

```experiments``` contains the code of the experiments presented in my report. It contains the code for computing the success rates of the different projections after the continuous optimization. It also contains the overfitting and initialization experiments.

```meetings``` contains the weekly reports of my ideas.

```reverse_engineering_llms``` and ```baseline``` contain my first tries. You can ignore them.
